## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.0] - 2022-09-17

### Added

-   Frodo now allows two new parameters when adding a connection profile:

    \--authentication-service [service]           Name of the authentication service/tree to use.

    \--authentication-header-overrides [headers]  Map of headers: {"host":"am.example.com:8081"}.

    These parameters are currently only supported in the `frodo conn add` command and the configuration elements will be automatically applied to commands issued using that connection profile.

        % frodo conn add https://platform.example.com:9443/am username password --authentication-service ldapService --authentication-header-overrides '{"host":"am.example.com:8081"}' -k
        ForgeOps deployment detected.

        Advanced setting: Authentication Header Overrides: 
        { host: 'am.example.com:8081' }
        %

    After the connection profile is created with the additional parameters, the environment can be accessed as usual. In this case it requires the `-k` parameter for every command, as the environment uses a self-signed certificate.

## [0.11.1-1] - 2022-08-21

### Added

-   Frodo CLI is now effectively using Frodo Library for all functionality except CLI.
    -   This changes has no effect on users using frodo binaries except for the download location of those binaries, which has now shifted to the [frodo-cli](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-cli) repo [release section](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-cli/releases).
    -   This change does affect users who run Frodo in `Developer Mode`. The exact effects and required actions are not yet fully documented and understood.
    -   This change does not effect the installation/update/usage process of users running the Frodo CLI NPM package. However, under the surface there is a big change in that the [Frodo CLI (@rockcarver/frodo-cli)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rockcarver/frodo-cli) package is now built on the new [Frodo Library (@rockcarver/frodo-lib)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rockcarver/frodo-lib).

### Changed

-   The output of `frodo -v` has changed to include all three versions: cli, lib, and node:
    ```console
    % frodo -v
    cli: v0.11.1-1
    lib: v0.11.1-6
    node: v18.7.0

## [0.9.2] - 2022-08-11

### Added

-   \#205: Added `--no-deps` option to `journey export`/`import` commands. This allows users to omit all external dependencies from a journey export and/or import. One use case where this comes in handy is when using frodo as a CI/CD tool to extract and deploy individual configuration artifacts and it is desirable to not mingle multiple types of configuration in a single file but keep each type of configuration in its own file for version and change control.
-   Added `--verbose` option to `journey export` command.
-   \#341: Added initial smoke tests to validate basic functionality.

### Changed

-   \#363: Frodo now performs dependency resolution and reports unresolved dependencies on single journey imports.
